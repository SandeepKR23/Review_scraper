## Review Scraper

## Overview
The Review Scraper is a Python-based tool designed to automatically extract product or service reviews from multiple e-commerce websites or review platforms. This project focuses on collecting customer feedback, reviews, and ratings, which can be used for data analysis, sentiment analysis, or to gather user insights for decision-making.

## Features
Automated Web Scraping: Scrapes reviews from websites automatically.

- Multi-page Support: Handles pagination to scrape reviews from multiple pages of a website.
- Customizable Fields: Allows you to customize the data fields you want to scrape, such as review text, rating, date of the review, and reviewerâ€™s name.
- Export Functionality: Exports scraped reviews to CSV or JSON for easy analysis and data handling.
- Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to manage issues like missing data or blocked pages.
- Scalable: Can be extended to support multiple websites with different structures.

## How It Works
This scraper uses Python libraries like BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and Requests for making HTTP requests. It retrieves the HTML content of the target pages, processes the data to extract relevant review information, and saves it in the desired output format.

## Key Steps:
1. Identify the target website: Configure the scraper to target specific websites and pages with reviews.
2. Parse the HTML: Using BeautifulSoup, the HTML structure of the page is parsed to locate review data.
3. Extract Review Data: The required fields such as reviewer name, review content, ratings, and date are extracted.
4. Handle Multiple Pages: Implement pagination handling to scrape reviews from all available pages.
5. Export Data: Save the scraped reviews in a structured format (CSV, JSON, etc.).

## Setup and Installation
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You'll also need the following Python libraries:

- requests: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
- beautifulsoup4: For parsing and navigating HTML documents.
- pandas: For managing and exporting scraped data.
- lxml: For faster HTML parsing (optional).

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/SandeepKR23/Review_scraper.git
cd Review_scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Configuration: Modify the target website URL and HTML tags in the configuration file (config.py) to suit the website you want to scrape.

2. Run the Scraper: Execute the main script to start scraping:

```
python scraper.py

```
3. Output: The scraped reviews will be saved in the specified output file (output.csv or output.json).

## Future Enhancements
- Captcha Handling: Integrate with services like 2Captcha or implement strategies to bypass Captcha verification.
- Headless Browser Support: Use Selenium or Playwright to handle websites that require JavaScript rendering.
- Sentiment Analysis: Extend the project by adding sentiment analysis to automatically classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
